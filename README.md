# Build Culture of ï»¿Systems Thinking and Smart Transparency

[Neelix.IO](https://team.neelix.io/) is designed to reduce reliance on traditional surveys by offering a dynamic and real-time feedback system. 

Through the Live Pulse model, team members can provide continuous feedback on various aspects of their joint experience, including team and organisational culture, leadership, communication, specific processes, specific projects, and more. This ensures that teams and leaders have an up-to-date understanding of the pulse of activities and culture without the need to adopt highly ritualised meetings and overbearing surveys. Grassroots-driven awareness of reality boosts authenticity of leadership.
